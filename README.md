# About

Based on a chapter of "PHP Programming with MySQL" by Don Gosselin.
Inspired by the great 4chan hack of 2025.


# TODO

- store name as cookie or some state manager...
- delete duplicates broken since added timestamps
- proper admin section (unfortunately to delete need to reference table rows)
- proper design (mvc?)
- text input formatting (eg newlines)...
- add timestamp sorts to topics, and alpabetical sort to messages
