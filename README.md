# About

Based on a chapter of "PHP Programming with MySQL" by Don Gosselin.
Inspired by the great 4chan hack of 2025.


# TODO

- delete duplicates broken since added timestamps
- proper admin section (unfortunately to delete need to reference table rows)
- add timestamp sorts to topics, and alpabetical sort to messages

# Notes

## setting-up

the `data` directory needs to be owned by `www-data` for read-write.
